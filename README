Cucumber-slicer
===============

This is a rails plugin that can be used to separate step definition files for each feature. 

By default, cucumber loads all *.rb files for executing the steps. This plugin changes this default behavior and the files inside "RAILS_ROOT/features/step_definitions/specific_feature_step_definitions" are loaded only if the name matches with the feature file being run.

For example:
------------

Running user_login.feature would load the file features/step_definitions/specific_feature_step_definitions/user_login_steps.feature

Why is this necessary?
======================

Sometimes it becomes necessary for steps to have same name but should behave differently with the context of from which feature it is being run.

Also, this removes the need to uniquely name steps based on slightly different implementations.

Example:
--------

For the following step,

    When password is changed to "something"

this step can be called either from user_settings.feature or admin_settings.feature. Correspondingly either,

    features/step_definitions/specific_feature_step_definitions/user_settings_steps.rb
        OR
    features/step_definitions/specific_feature_step_definitions/admin_settings_steps.rb

will be loaded and the file will contain the different implementations of step definition.
